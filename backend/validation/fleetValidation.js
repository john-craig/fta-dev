/*  
    - confirm the link to the player's military
    is still accessible
    - confirm that a sheet named "Navy" exists
    and contains the fields:
        - name
        - member
        - quantity
    - confirm that every String in the 'member'

    - if any of this is not correct, return a string
    explaining why
