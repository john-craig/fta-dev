This is much simpler because we don't have to deal with zooming in or out, or translation.

We just want to draw a solar system with planets and ships.

So to make things simple:
 - the star is going to be 1 "unit"
 - planets are 0.4 "units"
 - ships are 0.2 "units"

We still want to abstractify normal units from the screen's dimensions.
